#### About me
My name is Martin Asperholm. I'm a cognitive scientist interested in science, philosophy, design and the intersection between the three afformentioned fields. I also like to be creative.

Currently, I'm a PhD student at [The Division of Psychology](http://ki.se/en/cns/the-division-of-psychology) (where I'm also the Webmaster) at [Karolinska Institutet](http://ki.se/en/startpage) in Stockholm. I also sing in [Stockholm's University Choir](http://www.stockholmsuniversitetskor.se). My CV can be downloaded [here](./Martin Asperholm CV.pdf).

#### About this site
This site is my repository on the internet. It's where I will post and organize all the content that I've created and that I think is worth sharing. This site is still under construction, so expect it to change from time to time.

This site is hosted at <img src="/images/GithubLogo.svg" class=icon> [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/), which runs <img src="/images/JekyllIcon.svg" class=iconJekyll> [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), the deus ex machina of the web. To hear more about it, listen to [this episode of The Web Ahead](http://5by5.tv/webahead/54)</a>. If you want to host your own site on Github, I can warmly recommend [Tomas Bradley YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWjCJDeWfDdfVEcLGAfdJn_HXyM4Y7_k-) on the matter.

<!-- #### Other sites that I like
Outgoing links is one way of showing some internet love, nudging sites ever so slightly upwards in the Google search hierarchy. Let me therefore mention some sites that I think deserves all the love they can get: 

* <img src="/images/StackExchangeIcon.png" class=icon> [Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com/) is one of those sites that really makes you appreciate the power of the internet. It's a Q&A site where you can ask just about anything, as well as browsing the humonguosly large archive of already posed questions. I don't know how many times I've saved myself hours upon hours of frustration just by checking Stack Exchange first. <p><a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/178276/speldosa"><img src="http://stackexchange.com/users/flair/178276.png" width="208" height="58" alt="profile for Speldosa on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites" title="profile for Speldosa on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites" /></a></p>

* <img src="/images/VimeoIcon.svg" class=icon> [Vimeo](http://www.vimeo.com) is a real long-runner on the internet, and it has always been one of my favorite places to go whenever I need inspiration or when I just want to [share my latest creations](http://www.vimeo.com/speldosa). The fact that the site doesn't (and never will) feature any video adds, that it has a thriving and friendly community, and that the quality of the videos (both regarding the content and the technical aspects) are top-notch, makes it a really unique place. -->
